# Stargazing App Backlog

## Features to Re-implement
- **Vedic Tithi Calculation**: Calculate and display the current Tithi based on Moon and Sun positions.
- **Kundali Chart**: Display a South Indian style Kundali chart showing planetary positions (Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn) in the zodiac signs.
- **Planetary Positions**: Calculate heliocentric/geocentric positions for the chart.

## Notes
- These features were removed to simplify the initial version and rely on external APIs where possible.
- Previous implementation used `astronomy-engine` library.
